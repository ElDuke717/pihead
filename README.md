# PIHEAD - A simple site hosted on my Raspberry Pi 3B
## This site will have information about projects I've built and nonsense.

The blog will be the most exciting unvisited place on the internet.

Eventually, I plan on hosting real time weather data for my location using a weather station installed locally. Until then, it will host a simple blog.

Thanks for visiting.
