# CWB - A simple, local weather site and blog.

Welcome to CWB, a fusion of weather updates and personal musings. Get insights on the latest weather conditions and dive into interesting projects and some delightful nonsense.

## Background

Originally, CWB was hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3B, showcasing the versatility of microcomputers. However, for enhanced security and scalability, the hosting was shifted to a different platform.

## Features

- **Weather Updates**: Get real-time weather updates tailored for your location.
- **Blog**: Dive into a mix of technical articles about projects I've built, and some light-hearted nonsense to add a touch of whimsy.
- **Responsive Design**: Whether you access CWB on a phone, tablet, or desktop, expect a seamless user experience.
